<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
House Keeper is a [GitHub app](https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/) that subscribes to the following github [webhooks](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/) events:
1. [installation](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#installationevent). When `installation` webhook event of `created` action type is fired, the app fetches all the pull requests from allowed repository meeting the following conditions.
* Have a `status = 'opened'`
* Created by dependabot user.

2. [installation_repositories](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#installation_repositoriesevent). When `installation_repositories` webhook event of `added` action type is fired, the app through all the repos, fetches pull request that meets the conditions above, leaves a friendly comment and merges the branch.

3. [pull_request](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent). When `pull_request` webhook event of `opened` action type is fired, the app leaved a comment and merges the pull request if the creator of the pull request is dependabot.
